Here’s a **short README.md** you can use:

# Simple Python Calculator

This is a basic command-line calculator written in Python.
It performs four operations:

* Addition (`+`)
* Subtraction (`-`)
* Multiplication (`*`)
* Division (`/`)

## How It Works

1. The program asks the user to choose an operation.
2. It then asks for two numbers.
3. The result is displayed based on the selected operation.

## How to Run

1. Make sure Python is installed.
2. Save the code in a file (e.g., `calculator.py`).
3. Run the file using:

   ```bash
   python calculator.py
   ```

## Note

* Enter only valid numbers.
* Choose only `+ , - , * , /` when prompted.

If you want, I can also **fix the multiplication bug** or make the README even simpler 👍
